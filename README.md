Levenshtein Algorithm
---

Demonstration of 2 versions of the levenshtein algorithm for finding the difference between 2 strings. 

1. Classic non-recursive levenshtein method for returning the difference between string 1 and string 2

2. Modified version of levenshtein method that makes an early exit if the distance between 2 strings exceeds a maximum distance
